##General notes about Run_Analysis.R script

This scrypt does the following manipulations on the data:
	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	
Make sure you have extracted the content of the zipped file "getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip" into your working directory 
so that you have a folder named UCI HAR Dataset with all subfolders and files.
